AirBnB Clone Project

Description

The AirBnB Clone project is a part of a larger web application development.
It involves building a command-line interface (CLI) for managing AirBnB objects.
This project focuses on creating a foundation for the AirBnB application,
including defining object classes, serialization, deserialization, and basic object storage.

Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a fundamental component of this project. It allows users to interact with the system and
manage various AirBnB objects. The interpreter provides the following functionalities:

1. Create new objects, such as User, State, City, Place, etc.
2. Retrieve objects from storage (file, database, etc.).
3. Perform operations on objects, such as counting, computing statistics, and more.
4. Update attributes of objects.
5. Delete objects from the system.
