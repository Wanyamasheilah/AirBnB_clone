AirBnB Clone Project
Description
The AirBnB Clone project is a part of a larger web application development. It involves building a command-line interface (CLI) for managing AirBnB objects. This project focuses on creating a foundation for the AirBnB application, including defining object classes, serialization, deserialization, and basic object storage.

Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a fundamental component of this project. It allows users to interact with the system and manage various AirBnB objects. The interpreter provides the following functionalities:

Create new objects, such as User, State, City, Place, etc.
Retrieve objects from storage (file, database, etc.).
Perform operations on objects, such as counting, computing statistics, and more.
Update attributes of objects.
Delete objects from the system.
Getting Started
To start using the AirBnB Clone command interpreter, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airbnb-clone.git
Change into the project directory:

cd airbnb-clone
Run the command interpreter:

./console
How to Use
The command interpreter allows you to interact with the system using commands. Here are some common commands and how to use them:

Create a new object:

To create a new object, use the create command followed by the class name. For example, to create a new User object:

(hbnb) create User
Retrieve objects:

To retrieve objects, use the show or all command followed by the class name and optional object ID. For example, to show a specific User object:

(hbnb) show User 12345
Perform operations:

The interpreter supports various operations on objects, such as counting or computing statistics. The syntax for these operations may vary based on the specific task.

Update attributes:

To update attributes of an object, use the update command followed by the class name, object ID, attribute name, and new value. For example, to update a User's email:

(hbnb) update User 12345 email "newemail@example.com"
Delete objects:

To delete an object, use the destroy command followed by the class name and object ID. For example, to delete a State object:

(hbnb) destroy State 54321
Examples
Here are some usage examples:

Creating a new User:

(hbnb) create User
Retrieving a specific Place object:

(hbnb) show Place 98765
Updating a City's name:

(hbnb) update City 23456 name "New City Name"
Deleting a Review:

(hbnb) destroy Review 34567
This is just a basic overview of the AirBnB Clone command interpreter. The project will continue to evolve and include additional features and functionalities in future phases.
